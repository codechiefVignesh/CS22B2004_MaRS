#CS22B2004
I learnt many things in this task. I choose CSE because i love coding and here i was pleased to do it. I learnt using git bash, git etc. Handling git was a bit
difficult but i love typing those commands in linux terminal. I also swithced permanently from windows to ubuntu and i love it. The image processing was the easiest 
part of the task as i studied python in my 12th std. The initial bash question1 took me nearly two days to debug and understand its syntax. Overall the task gave 
me knowledge about coding and provided many resources to many things. Overall i enjoyed the task #2. I didnt try backdoor challenge yet. But although the deadline gets 
over i will try it afterwards. I also took help from my other friends in Mars and we discussed together about cloning and pushing in git.
